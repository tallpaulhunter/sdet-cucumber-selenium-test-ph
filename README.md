# sdet-cucumber-selenium-test

### Instructions

Write a functional automation test suite to provide appropriate coverage for the Costcutter store finder: https://www.costcutter.co.uk/location-finder/

It is up to you to decide on the details of the user journeys etc.

A basic Java project is provided for you with the following Maven dependencies:

* Cucumber with JUnit integration
* Selenium Webdriver with Chrome driver
* Logback for SLF4J logging

There are also some example Cucumber feature and steps files which should be replaced.

If you wish to add to these or use alternative libraries please feel free.  When you have completed the test, please submit your code either as a ZIP archive or provide a link to the checked in source in your personal Github or similar.
